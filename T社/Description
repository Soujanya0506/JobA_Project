## Case Study: AI Camera Monitoring of Shot Peening Process

### Overview
- Implementation of AI camera system to monitor unmanned coil machine (Bobin) during shot peening process
- Goal: Evaluate effectiveness of AI monitoring on reducing machine stoppage rates

### Setup
- 4 test cases
- Each case involves approximately 30 Bobins
- AI camera angle and location remain fixed throughout the study

### Monitoring Parameters
- **Working Hours**: ~8/9 AM to midnight
- **Stop Definition**: Machine halts for more than 5 minutes during working hours

### Objective
Determine which case demonstrates the best performance of unmanned Bobins in the shot peening process for small coiled parts, given the fixed AI camera setup.

### Data Collection
- Monitor and record stop rates for each case
- Compare performance across all 4 cases

### Expected Outcome
Identify the optimal setup or conditions that result in:
1. Lowest stop rate
2. Highest efficiency in the shot peening process
3. Best overall performance of unmanned Bobins

### Potential Factors to Consider
- Bobin configuration
- Shot peening parameters
- Environmental factors
- Time of day variations

### Next Steps
- Analyze collected data
- Identify patterns or correlations between setup and performance
- Formulate recommendations for process improvement
