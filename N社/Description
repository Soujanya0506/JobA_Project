# Machine Monitoring System at Nasu Seiki

## Project Overview

Implementing a real-time monitoring system for machine operations at 那須精機 (Nasu Seiki) using a three-color sensor system.

## Sensor System

* **Green**: Work in progress (稼働中)
* **Yellow**: Standby (中断)
* **Red**: Stopped (停止)

## Monitoring Parameters

1. Stop rates
2. Working hours
3. Operational status timings

## Data Collection Timeframes

* Daily
* Hourly
* Monthly
* Yearly

## Objective

Develop a real-time dashboard to monitor and detect abnormal machine stoppages, enabling quick response and improving overall efficiency.

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Status Visualization**: 
   - Instant color-coded representation of machine status

2. **Multi-timeframe Analysis**:
   - Ability to view and analyze data across various time periods

3. **Abnormality Detection**:
   - Algorithms to identify unusual patterns in machine operations

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Calculation and display of key performance indicators

## Expected Outcomes

1. Reduced downtime through early detection of issues
2. Improved machine utilization rates
3. Data-driven decision making for maintenance and operations
4. Enhanced overall productivity

## Next Steps

1. Implement the sensor system on all relevant machines
2. Develop and refine the real-time dashboard
3. Train staff on system usage and data interpretation
4. Establish protocols for responding to detected abnormalities
5. Continuously iterate and improve based on collected data and user feedback

## Potential Future Enhancements

* Integration with predictive maintenance systems
* Machine learning algorithms for advanced pattern recognition
* Mobile alerts for critical issues
